    <p>
      I’m Giel Cobben, a designer based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I create
      interfaces, shape brands and build digital products.

    <p>
      Over the last ten odd years I’ve had the pleasure of working with some
      great people, working side by side to design and develop apps and improve
      upon existing products. I mainly focus on designing clear, understandable
      interfaces and creating a goal oriented user experience through iteration
      and prototyping. I just love collaborating with passionate people and
      companies to make great apps.
